/**
 * writes.types.ts
 * ────────────────
 * Type contracts and path constants for the Firestore atomic-batch write
 * facade (`writes.svelte.ts`).
 *
 * ARCHITECTURE — Phase 1, Epic 1
 * ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Every Firestore write that must succeed-or-fail-together — and every
 * counter that must accumulate correctly across concurrent offline
 * devices — flows through `src/lib/services/writes.svelte.ts`.  This
 * module defines:
 *
 *   • PATHS                — single source of truth for collection paths
 *   • BatchWriteResult     — uniform return shape from every facade call
 *   • DrillCompletionPayload, GritAwardPayload, WorkoutCompletionPayload,
 *     MatchCompletionPayload — fully-typed input contracts
 *
 * No Firestore write API is imported here.  Logic lives in the facade.
 *
 * Offline guarantee
 * ─────────────────
 * Firestore's `persistentLocalCache` (enabled in `firebase.js`) buffers
 * every queued `writeBatch` while the device is offline.  When the client
 * regains connectivity the SDK flushes the queue atomically per-batch:
 * either all operations in a single `batch.commit()` land, or none do.
 *
 * `increment()` is the critical operator that makes counters offline-safe:
 * the server applies a DELTA, not an absolute snapshot, so two devices
 * both adding +50 XP while offline correctly produce +100 XP on the
 * server — never the last-writer-wins collapse to +50.
 *
 * Idempotency
 * ───────────
 * Every payload carries a client-generated `batchId` (UUID v4) so the
 * audit log can detect a replayed batch on the rare path where the SDK
 * retries after a partial server-side acknowledgement.

// ── Path constants ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

/**
 * Canonical Firestore collection / sub-collection paths used by the
