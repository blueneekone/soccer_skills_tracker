# Dev QA — phased pair-programming (Coach · Parent · Player)

**Environment:** `sports-skill-tracker-dev`  
**URL:** https://sports-skill-tracker-dev.web.app  
**Branch:** `dev`  
**Authority:** [`FUNCTIONAL_MVP.md`](vision/FUNCTIONAL_MVP.md) · [`FUNCTIONS_DEPLOY.md`](FUNCTIONS_DEPLOY.md)

Run **one phase per session** with the agent as your second pair of eyes. Paste phase results (pass/fail + notes) back into chat; agent updates blockers and tells you what to run next.

---

## How to pair-program with the agent

1. Confirm **Phase 0** deploy checklist is green (below).
2. Say: **"Start Phase N"** (e.g. *Start Phase 2 — Parent VPC*).
3. Run the steps in that phase on dev; report what you see (screenshots optional).
4. Agent checks expected vs actual, logs blockers, and clears you for the next phase.

**Do not skip Phase 0.** Phases 1–7 assume full stack on dev.

---

## Phase 0 — Full dev deploy (operator, agent-assisted)

Run before any human QA. Agent can execute; you confirm green checks.
