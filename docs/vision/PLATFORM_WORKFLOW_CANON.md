# Platform Workflow Canon

**Gold paths + step-by-step UX states for every Tier 1 surface** · Route authority: [`PRODUCT_SURFACE_REGISTRY.md`](./PRODUCT_SURFACE_REGISTRY.md) · Demo order: [`DEMO_SCRIPT.md`](../acquisition/DEMO_SCRIPT.md) exec cut · QA: [`OWNER_QA_CHECKLIST.md`](./OWNER_QA_CHECKLIST.md)

## §0 Authority

1. **Registry wins** on route tier, nav, and demo scope — this doc owns **human journey steps**, not which routes exist.
2. Every **Tier 1** registry row must appear in **GP-ACQ**, **GP-GATE**, **GP-COACH**, or **GP-PARENT** (GP-ACQ-04c satisfies PS-PL03 `/stats`).
3. **Gold path** = minimum acquisition narrative with defined entry, loading, empty, error, blocked, and success states per step.
4. Pixel vocabulary per persona: registry `foundation_doc` + `va_doc` columns.
5. Trust UX gates (`GP-GATE`) must pass before persona gold paths in owner QA.

---

## §1 Gold paths (minimum four)

| id | Name | Scope | Primary QA |
|----|------|-------|------------|
| **GP-ACQ** | Acquisition exec cut | [`DEMO_SCRIPT.md`](../acquisition/DEMO_SCRIPT.md) steps 1–6 | QA-401–406, QA-142 |
| **GP-COACH** | Coach daily loop | Squad hub → Forge deploy → player fulfillment → observe | QA-141, QA-142, QA-134 |
| **GP-PARENT** | Parent co-op loop | Household → VPC → co-op log → dashboard | QA-121–125, QA-131–132 |
| **GP-GATE** | Compliance gates | Login, setup, vpc-pending, coach clearance | QA-010–013, QA-133, QA-161 |

**Prerequisite chain:** `GP-GATE` → `GP-PARENT` (steps 1–2) unlocks player routes → `GP-COACH` step 3 feeds `GP-ACQ` step 4 → `GP-PARENT` step 5 → `GP-ACQ` step 6. Sign out / incognito between persona switches.

---

## §2 Step table format

All gold path steps use this schema:

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `step_id` | Stable id within gold path (e.g. `GP-ACQ-03`) |
| `actor` | Persona performing the step |
| `route` | Registry route |
| `user_action` | What the human does |
| `success_state` | Observable pass criteria |
| `failure_state` | Blocked / error UX requirement |
| `handoff_to` | Next workflow or persona |
| `qa_ids` | Owner QA checklist ids |
| `tier` | Registry tier (1 = acquisition required) |
| `mobile_notes` | 390px-first requirements |

---

## §3 Forge step — GP-ACQ-03 / GP-COACH-02 success criteria

**Route:** `/coach/forge` · **workflow_id:** `WF-COACH-FORGE` · **layout_pattern:** `coach-forge-workbench` (catalog: `full-page-workbench`)

Owner Phase 5 notes (QA-142) are **acceptance input** for VS-3-Forge (shipped):

| Criterion | Success | Failure (regression) |
|-----------|---------|----------------------|
| Mobile deploy form | Full deploy form visible on **390px** in document scroll — all fields above fold or in single column | Deploy panel not in document flow; `tw-fixed tw-bottom-*` reintroduced; form clipped on mobile |
| Roster scope | Assignable roster visible **OR** clear roster error with refresh — not silent empty dropdown | Roster dropdown empty with no explanation; deploy never enables |
| Deploy enablement | Deploy button enables when **attribute + duration + assignable targets** satisfied; `deployBlockReason` when false | Silent disabled button |
| Priority control | Boolean toggle — priority vs normal mission | Unbounded 0–100+ slider returns |
| Player handoff | Player sees bounty on `/player/dashboard` `ActiveBounties` within seconds | Intent not on mission rail |

**Blueprint:** [`coach-forge-workbench-v1.md`](./references/ui/research/blueprints/coach-forge-workbench-v1.md) · **`ForgeDeployPanel.svelte` shipped (VS-3-Forge)** — verify on live dev.

## §4 QA resume gate

Manual QA **Phases 5–11** remain **PAUSED** until owner initials all rows below. Phases 0–3 progress is preserved. Resume at **Phase 5** after owner signs §4 exit criteria.

| # | Exit criterion | Owner ☐ | Agent evidence |
|---|----------------|:-------:|----------------|
| 1 | [`PLATFORM_WORKFLOW_CANON.md`](./PLATFORM_WORKFLOW_CANON.md) gold paths GP-ACQ / GP-COACH / GP-PARENT / GP-GATE reviewed | | This doc merged |
| 2 | [`PLATFORM_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`](./PLATFORM_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md) layout catalog + shell contract reviewed | | Design system merged |
| 3 | Coach + Parent foundation + VA docs exist for all Tier 1 persona routes | | Registry `foundation_doc` / `va_doc` populated |
| 4 | [`coach-forge-workbench-v1.md`](./references/ui/research/blueprints/coach-forge-workbench-v1.md) signed — full-page workbench, not floating HUD | | Blueprint merged |
| 5 | GP-ACQ steps 1–6 match [`DEMO_SCRIPT.md`](../acquisition/DEMO_SCRIPT.md) exec cut table | | Step table §2 |
| 6 | `npm test -- src/lib/platform/__tests__/productSurfaceRegistry.test.ts` green | | CI / local |
| 7 | Verify VS-3-Forge on live (`ForgeDeployPanel`); workflow-integrity audit next | | Live dev QA-142 pass |

**Resume link:** [`OWNER_QA_CHECKLIST.md`](./OWNER_QA_CHECKLIST.md) Phase 5 — Coach → Player development loop.

## §5 Waivers — Tier 2 optional paths

Per registry §0 — waivable without blocking acquisition sign-off. Deep-link OK; not in exec cut.

| workflow_id | Route | Gold path | Notes |
|-------------|-------|-----------|-------|
| `WF-PARENT-LOG` | `/parent/log-workout` | GP-PARENT-03 | Co-op XP; Tier 2 |
| `WF-PARENT-PAY` | `/parent/payments` | — | Installments |
| `WF-COACH-DRILLS` | `/coach/drills` | — | QA-143/144 optional |
| `WF-COACH-LOGISTICS` | `/coach/logistics` | — | SafeSport broadcast |
| `WF-PLAYER-ARMORY` | `/player/armory` | — | Full demo Act 3 |
| — | `/coach/tactical` | — | Tier 2 War Room; `trinity-shell-glass-hud` layout **forbidden on Tier 1** |

Registry §0 gospel: [`PRODUCT_SURFACE_REGISTRY.md`](./PRODUCT_SURFACE_REGISTRY.md)

## §6 Workflow detail — UX state vocabulary

State vocabulary (all workflows):

| State | Meaning | UX requirement |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| **Entry** | First paint after navigation | 3-second hierarchy; obvious primary action |
| **Loading** | Awaiting Firestore / callable | Skeleton or inline spinner — never blank stall |
| **Empty** | Valid session, no data | Explain next step; CTA to fix |
| **Blocked** | Policy gate | Plain-language reason + link to resolving workflow |
| **Error** | Mutation or fetch failed | Actionable message + retry |
| **Success** | Commit verified | Inline confirmation; handoff CTA |

Extended workflow sections (trust gates, player stats, comms) remain valid reference — step ids above are authoritative for acquisition QA.

---

## §7 Agent usage

Before UX or functional work on a route:

1. Look up `workflow_id` in [`PRODUCT_SURFACE_REGISTRY.md`](./PRODUCT_SURFACE_REGISTRY.md) §1.
2. Find step in gold path tables (§2) for `qa_ids` and mobile_notes.
3. Read `foundation_doc` + `va_doc` for pixel sign-off.
4. Extend sprint tests — never delete prior guards.
