# Product Surface Registry

**Gospel truth** for user-facing routes, nav policy, demo scope, and owner QA tiers.  
**Project:** `sports-skill-tracker-dev` · **Branch:** `dev`  
**Authority chain:** This file → `[PLATFORM_WORKFLOW_CANON.md](./PLATFORM_WORKFLOW_CANON.md)` → `[DEMO_SCRIPT.md](../acquisition/DEMO_SCRIPT.md)` exec cut → `[OWNER_QA_CHECKLIST.md](./OWNER_QA_CHECKLIST.md)`

---

## §0 Gospel rules

1. **This registry wins** when it conflicts with `[COACH_OS.md](./COACH_OS.md)` home zones, `[FUNCTIONAL_AUDIT_BACKLOG.md](../FUNCTIONAL_AUDIT_BACKLOG.md)` Done rows (e.g. F2 War Room nav), `[FUNCTIONAL_MVP.md](./FUNCTIONAL_MVP.md)` primary-route lists, or `[ROADMAP.md](../../ROADMAP.md)` scope notes.
2. **Tier 1** — Pre-acquisition demo + owner QA **required**. Must pass or be explicitly waived before sign-off.
3. **Tier 2** — Shipped code may exist; not in primary nav (deep-link OK); **waivable** in QA without blocking functional sale.
4. **Tier 3** — Tabled post-acquisition; agents **do not** extend, nav-link, or prioritize without owner registry update.
5. **Nav policy** — **Tier 1** = pre-acquisition required for functional sign-off (or explicit waiver in §4). **Tier 2+** routes may remain in sidebar per §2; they are waivable and not exec-cut blockers per §0 rules 2–3. `nav_visible=false` = hidden from primary nav (deep-link only) — e.g. War Room PS-C04. Do not remove Tier 2 coach/parent links from §2; they are intentional and waivable.
6. **Nav chrome** — Layout law (field/desk breakpoints, Option D pin bar + AppMenuSheet, skin separation) → [`PLATFORM_NAVIGATION_CANON.md`](./PLATFORM_NAVIGATION_CANON.md). This registry §2 remains **href source of truth**; `navPinCatalog.ts` + shells must not duplicate nav arrays.
